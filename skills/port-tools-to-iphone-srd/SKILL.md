name: port-tools-to-iphone-srd
description: Port an existing command-line tool, daemon, shell, library-backed utility, or Unix software project to an Apple iPhone Security Research Device (SRD). Use when Codex needs to cross-compile for arm64e iOS with Xcode, adapt Autoconf or Make builds, answer cross-compile runtime probes, graft selectively available headers, remove unsupported APIs or modules, choose static versus dynamic linkage, patch randomized cryptex resource paths, assemble and sign a cryptex root, add srdtool installation targets, or validate the finished Mach-O and runtime resources.

# Port tools to an iPhone SRD

## Define the port

Write acceptance criteria before editing:

- Target architecture and minimum iOS version.
- Required commands, libraries, modules, plugins, and data files.
- Interactive behavior such as PTYs, key maps, terminal capabilities, history,
  and signals.
- Runtime entry point: `srdtool research spawn`, launch daemon, SSH, or wrapper.
- Persistent and writable state locations.
- Install identifier and replacement behavior.

Inspect the upstream source, build system, license, current release, and
checksum source. Pin an immutable source archive and verify it before extracting.

Read [references/porting-playbook.md](references/porting-playbook.md) for
build patterns and failure diagnosis. Read
[references/zsh-case-study.md](references/zsh-case-study.md) when the target
uses Autoconf, modules, terminal UI, completion data, or compiled resource
paths.

## Inspect the SRD reference implementation

Locate Apple's `security-research-device` repository. Read, in order:

1. `example-cryptex/README.md`
2. `example-cryptex/build_env.mk`
3. `example-cryptex/Makefile`
4. The closest example under `example-cryptex/src/`
5. Current `srdtool ... --help`

Reuse current patterns, but do not copy obsolete SDK names, deployment targets,
or command flags blindly.

## Characterize incompatibilities

Inventory:

- Build-time tools that must run on the Mac versus target binaries.
- Configure tests that execute target programs.
- Headers present only in macOS, XNU sources, or private SDKs.
- APIs unavailable on iOS.
- Dynamic modules, plugins, `dlopen`, and fixed module directories.
- Subprocess, PTY, networking, locale, terminfo, user database, and filesystem
  assumptions.
- Embedded paths such as `/usr/share`, `/etc`, `/usr/lib`, and `/var`.
- Files generated during the build and whether they use the target preprocessor.

Prefer feature reduction over fake detection. Disable obsolete or unsupported
components explicitly and document the loss.

## Build for the actual target

Resolve tools and SDKs through `xcrun`. Apply the same target flags to compile,
preprocess, and link steps:

```text
-isysroot <iphoneos-sdk>
-arch arm64e
-miphoneos-version-min=<version>
```

For Autoconf:

1. Build out of tree.
2. Set `CC`, `CPP`, `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS` explicitly.
3. Pass a native Mac build tuple and an arm64e Darwin host tuple.
4. Cache only runtime checks that cannot execute while cross-compiling.
5. Derive cached answers from SDK headers, source inspection, platform ABI, or
   a justified native-Darwin comparison. Never guess.

Graft a missing header only after verifying the corresponding ABI or system
library exists on iOS. Copy the smallest required header set into a private
compatibility include directory. Do not link macOS libraries into the target.

## Design for cryptex runtime constraints

Prefer one signed executable with required modules linked statically when
upstream dynamic loading depends on fixed paths or unsigned bundles.

Install into a distribution root such as:

```text
<name>-cryptex.root/
├── Library/LaunchDaemons/
├── usr/bin/
├── usr/lib/
└── usr/share/
```

Ad hoc sign every Mach-O after its final modification. Include all required
functions, terminfo, locale, configuration, schemas, certificates, or helper
data.

Never compile a randomized cryptex mount point. Use `CRYPTEX_MOUNT_PATH` in
launchers and patch resource lookup when upstream insists on absolute paths.
Preserve normal user paths such as `HOME`, history, and user startup files.

## Make the workflow reproducible

Provide separate targets for:

```text
download -> source/patch -> configure -> build -> cryptex -> check -> install
```

Also provide `clean`, `distclean`, and useful overrides. Make downloads
atomic, validate checksums, apply patches deterministically, and rebuild a
cryptex root from scratch.

Resolve `srdtool` from `PATH` first and allow an explicit override. An install
target should validate the cryptex before invoking:

```sh
srdtool cryptex install \
  --persist \
  --identifier <stable.identifier> \
  <absolute-cryptex-root>
```

Inspect local help before fixing option order or names.

## Validate proportionately

Run `scripts/validate-srd-binary.sh` on every primary executable:

```sh
skills/port-tools-to-iphone-srd/scripts/validate-srd-binary.sh \
  path/to/cryptex.root/usr/bin/tool arm64e 15.0
```

Also verify:

- required modules were linked or packaged;
- expected resources and launch plists exist;
- no target step silently used host headers or libraries;
- startup files work from a randomized mount;
- non-interactive features pass deterministic smoke tests;
- interactive tools work on an actual PTY over SSH;
- the same-identifier reinstall path behaves correctly.

Do not claim full success from host-side inspection alone. State clearly when
device validation remains.

## Preserve maintainability

- Keep upstream changes in numbered patch files.
- Explain every configure-cache answer.
- Keep version, URL, checksum, architecture, deployment target, identifier,
  and tool paths visible near the top of the build.
- Avoid copying generated build products into source control.
- Document intentionally omitted functionality.
- Re-run a clean build after editing patches or compatibility headers.
